# Notes

## Generated the frontend(NextJS) using the following commands

```bash
npm install --save-dev @nrwl/next
nx g @nrwl/next:app frontend
```

## Generated the backend(NestJS) using the following commands

```bash
npm install --save-dev @nrwl/nest
nx g @nrwl/nest:app backend
```

## How to run both apps for development

```bash
nx serve frontend
nx serve backend
```

## How to run apps for production

```bash
nx serve frontend --prod
nx serve backend --prod
```

## How to auto format all apps

```bash
nx format:check     # returns all un-formatted files, doesn't format
nx format:write     # returns all unformatted files AND formats them
```

## How to lint both apps

```bash
nx lint frontend
nx lint backend
```

## How to test both apps

```bash
nx test frontend
nx test backend
```

## How to add resource to the nestjs backend

```bash
nx g @nrwl/nest:resource users --project=backend    # add --dry-run to see changes without writing to disk

# IMPORTANT:
# For some reason, generating the users resource works as expected, EXCEPT it does not
# automatically import the UsersModule into the AppModule. You will have to do this manually
# or else it will not work. Use the UsersModule as an example for future resources.
```
